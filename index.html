        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>Early Life</h3>
          <p>I was born in Westwood, New Jersey. I have lived in New Jersey for a majority of my life in Oakland, New Jersey. I have attended Ramapo High school in Franklin Lakes. I was a good student with a hobby and academic focus in art. I have fenced in high school for three years. I was a captain for two years. Overtime, I have irritated a sports injury that is the reason I don't fence currently.

          <h3>Education</h3>
          <p>I have spent many years in an art class. I have a home studio, which is a cluttered corner of my room. I have studied design and fine arts. I can work in many art mediums. The digitals medias were more difficult to adjust to and learn however I consider myself skilled in many programs.</p

          <h3>Currently</h3>
          <p> I was accepted into Drexel University in 2016 for the Interactive Digital Major. I have not had any prior education for coding languges or computers. My freshmen year was very overwhelming, but I pulled through with the support of peers and professors.
          I chose Interactive Digital Media because the skill set that Drexel will teach me will can be applied in a wide range of jobs. My ideal career is not to be in one position doing one job. I would like to explore many roles in many fields. IDM stretches across many fields that will allow me to keep learning and make the best product for that field. One day I hope to grow into the role of a project manager or a creative director for projects. </p>
